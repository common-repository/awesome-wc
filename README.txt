## AWESOME IS PERFECT FOR ##

* Selling physical products
* Selling digital products
* Selling online courses
* Selling services

Awesome is perfect for selling anything online! It doesn't matter what you sell, we make sure that your customers can buy your product as easily and fast as possible.

## WHAT CAN I CUSTOMIZE? ##

With our component, you will have full control of:

## The Cart ##
Take the cart and mini-cart to the next level! You can customize all the default areas of the cart and mini-cart but also, we have enhanced the default functionality. We have added the *Save for Later* list and the **Buy it Again** functionality directly on the cart and mini-cart.

The **Save for Later** list gives your customers a place to save those products they're interested in without blocking their shopping cart. They’ll be able to move items from the list to the cart, and vice versa, anytime they want.

* **Buy it Again** functionality shows your customer what they have bought in their past orders, this way they can add them to the cart with just a click.

* **Product suggestions** is also an enhanced functionality that we integrated to the cart component. This will use the empty space on you mini-cart to show product recommendations based on the items your customers already have in the shopping cart.

## The Checkout ##
Your customers want faster checkouts! Simplify the checkout experience resulting in much less abandonment and more sales. 

* **Login process**
We have integrated the login and registration process with the checkout, now your customers won't have to leave the checkout page to create an account. This simple, but effective, change in the checkout process has proven to reduce checkout abandonment.

* **Step by step** 
We have segregated the checkout process into 3 easy steps. First, we concentrate in the customer information. Second, we ask the customer for the shipping method, if applies. And third, the payment information. That’s it. It’s that easy!

* **Payment methods**
Our checkout process works with virtually all payment methods. We maintain the WooCommerce default checkout payment structure to ensure that the payment methods work with our component.

* **Thank you page**
We’ve also re-design the default thank you page. Once your customers finished their purchase, they can view their order summary and details in a more attractive and organized way.

## My Account ##
An account page that makes sense. Get rid of the boring and useless WooCommerce account page. We will transform the “My Account” page into a fun and easy to use tool.

* **Dashboard**
Show your customers what they expect from an account page right from the start. Our dashboard will give your clients all recent activity in your store and, also, enhanced links to every section of the widget.

* **Orders**
We have redesigned the default order page and the order details as well. With these changes the order information is more organized for a better understanding. We have also included new functionality like the “Buy it again” button on the order details.

* **Control**
You can choose what sections of the “My Account” page you want your customers to be able to use. For example, if you don’t sell any digital products there is no reason for the downloads section to be there. If you don’t need it, hide it!

## The Product List ##
Display a clean stylish catalog with extra functionality that your customers will enjoy.

* **Product Catalog**
The catalog is a very important part of your online store, you should treat it like so. With the Product List component, you can have a clean and neat catalog that your customers will love.

* **Product Templates**
We have created a set of predefined templates that you can choose from. Just show or hide the information you want your customers to view.

* **Quick View**
Save your customers time with our quick view feature. Give your customers a sneak peek of the product they’re interested in without leaving your product catalog.

* **Customizable**
We put you in control of what is important. Show only the information you want the customer to see, hide the rest. It’s that easy!

## NEW FEATURES ##

**We are constantly improving** our components and adding new features. But that's not all, we also release new components regularly that will let you modify new aspects of the WooCommerce store.

You will be able to see and download all updates and components in the Awesome Manager page.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 4.0 or greater

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "Awesome for WC" and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating, and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favorite FTP application. The
WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

If on the off-chance you do encounter issues with the shop/category pages after an update you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and hitting 'save'. That should return things to normal.
